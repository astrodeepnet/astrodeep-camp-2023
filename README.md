## Program

The program is yet to decide and **we need your input** for that.

We have started a suggestion of activities [here](https://github.com/astrodeepnet/retreat-2023/issues) that you can start reviewing and possibly adding yourself to if you are interested.

To propose your own set of activities (please do!) fill up the [short template](https://github.com/astrodeepnet/astrodeep-camp-2023/issues/new?template=ACTIVITY-FORM.yml) so we can start brainstorming on them.
